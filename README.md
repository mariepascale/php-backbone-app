## PHP Backbone Example

This is a simple example to demonstrate how to use backbone with php.

#### Setup
The start() method begins the process. The model is called to get the json data which is contained within a php file.  The data is rendered in a backbone template.

```
shop.php - json data

shop.js - model and router

index.html - view
```
